# //--------problem
# // If you're new to linked lists, this is a great exercise for learning about them. Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.

# // Input Format

# // The first line of input contains , the number of elements in the linked list.
# // The next  lines contain one element each, which are the elements of the linked list.

# // Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.

# // Constraints

# // , where  is the  element of the linked list.
# // Output Format

# // Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using printf, cout, etc.). There should be one element per line.

# // Sample Input

# // 2
# // 16
# // 13
# // Sample Output

# // 16
# // 13
# // Explanation

# // There are two elements in the linked list. They are represented as 16 -> 13 -> NULL. So, the printLinkedList function should print 16 and 13 each in a new line.

# //--------pseudocode

# If the head value is not null, print head and then print head.next. 

# The solution is a recursive function to continue printing until the head.next does not equal null or none





# //--------solution

def printLinkedList(head):
    if head is not None: 
      print(head.data)
      printLinkedList(head.next)
